Functional Data Analysis (FDA) is an ever-increasing branch of statistics that deals with the analysis of high-dimensional observations where features can be naturally indexed with respect to an independent variable (e.g., time or space). Within this framework, outlier detection and robust statistics are not yet a well-established practice, and recent research has been devoted in trying to provide straightforward graphical tools to help practitioners in identifying anomalous datum in a functional dataset. Among the available options, the functional boxplot is one of the most common tool adopted to identify and visualise outliers in FDA. A crucial requirement of the functional boxplot is the control of the proportion of genuine yet atypical observations flagged as outliers, which is ruled by the inflation factor F of the fences. While an F value of 1.5 is standard for most situations, careful choice of F marks the shift in the use of the functional boxplot from a mere visualisation tool to an instrument able to combine visualisation and inferential conclusions about outlyingness. By leveraging on recently introduced robust procedures, the project aims at developing a computational and data-driven method for the calculation of F.
